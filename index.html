		<h1>Founders Resilience</h1>
		<h2>Who we are</h2>
		<p>Startup founders, employees&mdash;really, attempting-world changers of any stripe&mdash;seeking reminders, methods and encouragement to maintain a healthy and happy mind.</p>
		<h2>Why I started this</h2>
		<p>After what felt like a flood of coming-out stories about founders' mental health battles, particularly with depression, it seemed clear many struggle in silence balancing the startup lifestyle's pressures<!--: long hours of constantly evolving challenges-->.</p>
		<p>Human needs, like being able to relax and be vulnerable, get neglected; the natural product of an enviroment loud on achievement while silent on struggle. We seek to redress that balance, becoming stronger&mdash;and most importantly, happier&mdash;in the process.</p>
		<h2>What we aim to provide</h2>
		<p>A space to recuperate, untangle personal challenges and grow with other creative folk. Sharing the unique challenges of the startup lifestyle and foster a more healthy relationship with ambition!</p>
		<h2>I want to be a part of this!</h2>
